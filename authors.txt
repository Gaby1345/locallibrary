EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS FOR DATABASE POPULATION

As we were not able to include populate_catalog.py in the initialization script because of
primary keys duplication when adding new books in the different databases, and we think that
you will do that in an empty local database for testing purposes, we recommend the following
steps before testing:

export TESTING=1
python3 populate_catalog.py (with an empty database already created)
sh build.sh

We suposed that the database in neon should not be populated again as we did it when creating it, 
and when we tried to apply populate later, it was just adding copies and copies but the books were
not being included properly because of the ISBN duplication as primary key, so it had no sense to include 
the mentioned file in the build.sh script in this case also.

We hope this was the right decision as we tried to fix it in so many ways.

CREATE SUPERUSER SCRIPT

Also, this functionality appears in the coverage of the tests, but as it is not part of the application
itself, we did not know if it was right to test it. All the tests from the application and challenges
included are 100% passed, hope it is fine.
